Notes

1. TF can be used to integrate the gripper into the computation. 

2. The resource I know is almost the instruction for how to generate ikfast code and install ikfast-moveit plugin. Here is a ikfast demo that shows how to use ikfast in our code: 
	http://kaist-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/arm_kinematics_tools/src/ikfastdemo/ikfastdemo.cpp. 

You can find the related code in the parent directory. Other resources:
